# Glove-Mouse
A glove mouse that can replace your physical mouse and keyboard.
We invented a glove mouse that can control the cursor, left click and right click, scroll up and down, and predict the alphabets from the gesture. Gate recurrent neural network used the angular velocity of the three-axis as input to predict the alphabets written by users. The purpose of this device is to provide all users with a keyboard and mouse that can be used in their most comfortable posture. It solves the problem of poor posture caused by computer users who have long placed their hands and shoulders in line with the table and the keyboard. 
In this experiment, we want to refine the prediction model by using different kinds of dimension reduction methods and classifiers.
